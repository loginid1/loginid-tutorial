# Metadata fields start with an underscore (_)
# Fields that do not start with an underscore represent Kong entities and attributes

# _format_version is mandatory,
# it specifies the minimum version of Kong that supports the format

_format_version: "2.1"

# _transform is optional, defaulting to true.
# It specifies whether schema transformations should be applied when importing this file
