	h2 Generate Codes

	h3 Push Authentication Code

	p This will create a temporary code. This can be used to enable a user to login to his account without having to register this device as a permanent authenticator. As soon as the code is generated, this device will poll LoginID until the user has granted the code on his first device! <strong>Good to know</strong>: this device does not need to be FIDO2 enabled!

	h3 Add Authentication Code

	p This is used to add an additional, permanent authenticator to the users account. As soon as the code has been granted via the first device, the user can select “Add Credential” and this authenticator will be added!
