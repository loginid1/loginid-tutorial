<h2>Create Transaction Confirmation</h2>
<p>LoginID provides a feature called <a href="https://docs.loginid.io/Guides/Flows/tx-conf-guide"
                                        target="_blank"><strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong></a> which is
    the process of signing a message using the users FIDO2 key.</p>
<p>This client takes a given payload and sends it to its backend which requests a <strong>transactionId</strong> from
    LoginID. Once that is
    received, it is passed back to this client. This client then prompts the user to confirm the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong><br/>The relationship between <strong>Payload, TransactionId</strong> and <strong>Transaction Confirmation</strong> has to be managed
    by the client!</p>
<p>This also means that the client is responsible for maintaining the payload as long as verifications are supported!</p>

<form>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="txtPayload">Payload to be signed</label>
        <textarea class="form-control" id="txtPayload" rows="3"></textarea><br/>
        <button id="btnTxId" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"
                onclick="return initiateTransaction('/users/trx');">Initiate Transaction
        </button>
    </div>
</form>
<hr/>
<p>Confirm the transaction once the transactionId has been received!</p>
<form>
    <table class="table-condensed">
        <tr>
            <td><label for="transactionId">TransactionID</label></td>
            <td><input type="text" class="form-control" id="transactionId" size="50" readonly/></td>
            <td>
                <button id="btnTxIdConfirm" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"
                        onclick="return confirmTransaction(dw);">Confirm Transaction
                </button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</form>

<h3>Transaction Verifications</h3>
<p>There are two types of verifications a client can implement locally:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Verifying the payload based hash against this value: <strong>tx_hash</strong> Calculation: <code>tx_hash == base64url(SHA256(payload + nonce + server_nonce))</code></li>
    <li>Verifying the jwt-signature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong><br/>The Transaction Confirmation returns a token (JWT) and a success indicator. However, the below API response attaches the base64url decoded jwt_header and jwt_payload for convenience!</small></p>
